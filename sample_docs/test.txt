This document describes a novel retrieval system for enterprise knowledge bases.

## Main Contribution

The main innovation is citation-based retrieval. It uses hybrid retrieval (BM25 + embeddings) to improve accuracy. The system achieves 85% precision on benchmark datasets.

## Key Assumptions

The system assumes limited context windows in large language models. It also assumes documents can be chunked into semantically coherent sections.

## Limitations

The current implementation does not support real-time updates. Chunking may split semantically related content if sections exceed 800 characters.
